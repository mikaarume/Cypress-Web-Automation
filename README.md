This is about testing using cypress 
To run Cypress tests from the command line, follow these steps:

Install Cypress: If you haven't already, install Cypress in your project directory using the following command:
npm install cypress --save-dev

Run Cypress Tests: After installation, you can run Cypress tests using the following command:
npx cypress run

This command will execute your Cypress tests in the terminal in headless mode. It will run all the test files in the integration folder of your project.
Specifying a Specific Test File: If you want to run a specific test file, you can use the --spec flag. For example:
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/my-test.spec.js"

Using a Different Browser: By default, Cypress runs tests in an Electron browser. You can run tests in other browsers like Chrome or Firefox using the --browser flag. For example:
Generating Reports: Cypress generates detailed HTML and Mocha-based JSON reports by default. You can specify the folder to store the reports using the --reporter flag. For example:
npx cypress run --reporter junit --reporter-options "mochaFile=results/results-[hash].xml"

Remember to replace file paths and names with actual paths and filenames from your project.

The npx command is used to run packages that are not globally installed. It ensures you're using the version of Cypress installed in your project's node_modules folder.

For more advanced usage and configuration options, refer to the official Cypress documentation: https://docs.cypress.io/
